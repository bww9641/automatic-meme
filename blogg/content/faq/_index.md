It's pretty hard for me to summarize in a few words who I am. But a TL;DR would look something like this.

\**Radu**, 17 y/o interested in Social Sciences (especially politics and economics), Marketing enthusiast and fun guy to have around.

\## Writing

I mostly do this because of the practice. A big proportion of everything that we consume nowadays comes in the form of written material. It's also a good exercise for me since I sometimes find it hard to collect all my thoughts in one place.

You'll find most of my written material \[here\](/blog "Blog | Radu Ciurca"), but I do also (sometimes) post articles on other platforms, so subscribing to my newsletter wouldn't be a bad call.

\## Categories

I've found that just having one place holding all my articles is better than having multiple places holding written material. You'll be able to access my articles categorized over \[here\](/categories "Categories | Radu Ciurca").

\## Work

I'm currently studying Social Sciences and writing on this website. To see my professional profile, access my LinkedIn from \[here\](linkedin.com/in/raduciurca "LinkedIn Profile | Radu Ciurca").
