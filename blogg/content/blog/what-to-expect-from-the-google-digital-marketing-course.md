## Context

I really got interested in marketing in the beginning of this summer. After reading and learning a little bit about the subject, I stumbled upon Google's free [Digital Marketing Fundamentals Course](). It seemed like it would be worth my time. so I decided to take it.

## What to expect

The course takes approximately 40 hours to complete, and after that you can take a test and if you pass it, you receive a certificate with your name.

Now, the name of the course is Fundamentals of Digital Marketing. And it's right, it teaches you just the fundamentals, so don't expect to become a full on marketer after completing this course.

This course seems to be pointed to business owners that would want to take their business online. And of course, since it's from Google, they promote their ad services a lot.

The structure is simple: it has 26 modules that take around 40 hours to compete.

Each module has videos explaining the subject, after which you have a mini-test to evaluate your knowledge on the subject. They really take your time, so if you already have a profound knowledge when it comes to marketing, or just how the internet works, really, you might find it boring. A lot of times, I just skipped and did the test for the whole module, because I knew what they were explaining.

## Should you take it?

If you **are an absolute beginner**, then yes. I think if you work in the digital world, it's good knowledge to have, plus, it's free. You can literally do it anytime you want, however you want.

If you are **a marketer** or you have **a strong knowledge** when it comes to marketing, you might want to consider some factors. The certificate is never a bad thing, but you should really think if that pays out for the time spent doing it.

## TL;DR

The Digital Marketing Fundamentals course from Google, is great if you don't know anything about marketing or is just a beginner. Even people that have experience when it comes to Digital Marketing, can benefit, maybe from the actual knowledge, or maybe just the certificate.

PS: [Here]() you can validate my certification code (**H73 SWB ZZB**) to confirm that I actually took the course.
