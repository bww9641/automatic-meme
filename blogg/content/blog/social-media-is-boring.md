# Context

I feel like social media got boring - at least for me. I remember the days I couldn't wait to check out what was new on it. Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, you name it, I was probably on it.

I think I was an addict, like many of us. I needed my hit, and social media could satisfy that need. It was like a drug dealer that dealt the coolest new drug. It was **cool**, **fresh**, something **out of the ordinary**.

## What happened?

About a year ago I wanted to see how much I could go without any form of social media. I uninstalled social media and had a pretty good run. Granted, I still checked it from time to time, but it wasn't as convenient with the apps **uninstalled**.

Nowadays the only social media app that I have installed on my phone is **Twitter**. I use Twitter mostly to find out new tips and tricks in the Growth Marketing world. It's also convenient to use it, since no one really uses it in Romania (where I'm from). The only person that I share things on Twitter with is <a href="[https://www.tudorcodes.com/](https://www.tudorcodes.com/ "https://www.tudorcodes.com/")" target="_blank">my brother</a>.

I check Facebook and Instagram just for the **notifications**, I find it useful for events and such, but other than that, I don't spent much time on them. It's the same people, the same stuff, nothing much really changes. I still find myself sometimes looking at video memes on Facebook, cause I often find them hilarious, but I find myself doing that mainly on a computer.

## A status game

One thing that I started to understand was that most people play a status game on these platforms. Who can get the **most likes**, who can **share** the funniest memes, who can get a **mention** from a celebrity. I don't think many people would actually use them if it wasn't cool, if a lot of other people wouldn't use them. Meanwhile companies profit of off the fact that you like to share as much information as possible. (don't get me wrong, if you signed up to something willingly, accept the consequences).

## Conclusion

I don't think social media is necessarily a bad thing if you know how to ration it. Nothing is good taken in big quantities. Learn how to use social media **to your advantage**. Leverage it. Understand how it works, so you can use it as a tool.
