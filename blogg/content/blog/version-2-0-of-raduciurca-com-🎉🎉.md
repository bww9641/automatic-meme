# Welcome to raduciurca.com 2.0

I wasn't really happy with my old website/theme. So I decided to change up things a bit. This site is more light, clearer and to the point.

My scope hasn't changed, but the look has.

## What tools am I using for this website?

This website is written in <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>, the theme is <a href="https://github.com/jeblister/kube" target="_blank">Kube</a> and I am writing this article in <a href="https://github.com/jeblister/kube" target="_blank">Forestry</a>.

The website is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> and I don't pay a dime since it's a static website.

## What to look for?

Navigation is now easy. You can use the Navigation Bar up top to go to various places, or just go to [Categories](https://raduciurca.com/categories "Categories | Radu Ciurca")<a href="https://forestry.io/" target="_blank">Forestry</a> to get all the content that I have organized.

## What holds for the future?

I'm still using this site/blog (whatever you want to call it) as a place where I can put all my creative, personal and professional resources.
