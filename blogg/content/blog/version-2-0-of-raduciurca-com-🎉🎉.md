# Welcome to raduciurca.com 2.0

I wasn't really happy with my old website/theme. So I decided to change up things a bit. This site is more light, clearer and to the point.

My scope hasn't changed, but the look has.

## What tools am I using for this website?

This website is written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "Hugo link"), the theme is [Kube](https://github.com/jeblister/kube "Kube theme link") and I am writing this article in [Forestry](https://forestry.io/ "Forestry CMS").

The website is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Netlify host") and I don't pay a dime since it's a static website.

## What to look for?

Navigation is now easy. You can use the Navigation Bar up top to go to various places, or just go to [Categories](https://raduciurca.com/categories "Categories | Radu Ciurca"){:target="_blank"} to get all the content that I have organized.

## What holds for the future?

I'm still using this site/blog (whatever you want to call it) as a place where I can put all my creative, personal and professional resources.
